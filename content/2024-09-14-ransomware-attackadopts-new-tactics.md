Ransomware, a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key, has been a persistent threat to individuals and organizations for years. Recently, ransomware attackers have adopted new tactics to evade detection and maximize their profits. One trend that has gained attention is the use of "double extortion" tactics, where attackers not only encrypt the victim's data but also steal sensitive information that is then used to extort additional payments. This hybrid approach adds a level of complexity to the traditional ransomware attack, making it more challenging for organizations to respond and recover.
