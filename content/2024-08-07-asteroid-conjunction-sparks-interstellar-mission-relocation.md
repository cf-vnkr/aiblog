Asteroid 110th Conjunction, a massive celestial body roughly 1.5 kilometers in diameter, is poised to swing by Earth in a mere 15 days, prompting scientists to scramble for alternative mission locations for the upcoming Interstellar Probe, a historic endeavor planned to conclude in 2023. The likelihood of a near-miss event with such a massive asteroid is extremely rare, and while astronomers warn it's unlikely to cause any damage, the possibility of collateral effects during the event has been deemed considerable. A release from the Center for Interstellar Security echoes the experts' concerns, highlighting the unforeseen dangers that small asteroids, such as temporary perturbations in planetary trajectories, can cause.
