A new study has found that eating breakfast can improve cognitive function and memory in children. The study, conducted by researchers at a leading university, discovered that children who ate breakfast performed better on tests of attention and memory compared to those who skipped the morning meal. The researchers suggest that breakfast helps to provide a boost of energy and helps children to stay focused throughout the day. This is good news for parents who are looking for ways to support their child's education and development.
