The rapid advancements in gene editing technology, particularly the development of the CRISPR-Cas9 tool, have opened up unprecedented possibilities for treating and potentially eradicating genetic diseases. Scientists are now able to edit genes with unprecedented precision, promising to revolutionize the field of medicine. However, this breakthrough has also raised a multitude of ethical concerns that must be carefully considered. As gene editing becomes more accessible and widespread, the potential for misuse and unintended consequences grows.
