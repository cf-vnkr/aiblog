In a groundbreaking announcement, Astro Tech Industries revealed plans to further expand its Astral Horizon space exploration program. The ambitious project, which aims to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars, has been successfully progressing over the past decade with several expeditions already conducted by the company's trained astronaut teams. As the venture enters its next phase, Astral Horizon is set to deploy a state-of-the-art spacecraft, the Ares-X, later this year. Capable of transporting up to 20 colonists at a time, the Ares-X marks a significant milestone in the space travel technology with its advanced propulsion system and life support systems.
