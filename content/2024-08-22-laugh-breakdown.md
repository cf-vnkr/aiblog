Have you ever found yourself laughing uncontrollably at something silly, only to suddenly stop and wonder why you're even laughing in the first place? You're not alone. Laugh breakdowns are a common phenomenon where a fit of laughter suddenly turns into tears, gasping for air, or just plain confusion. Research suggests that laugh breakdowns occur when our brains can't keep up with the rapid-fire processing of humor, causing a temporary overload that results in a breakdown. Whether it's a joke that's just too silly or a hilarious meme that's just too relatable, laugh breakdowns can be a result of our brains trying to process humor more intensely than we're used to.
