A major cyber attack has hit a leading financial institution, compromising sensitive customer data and potentially compromising financial security for thousands of individuals. The attack, which was discovered earlier today, involves unauthorized access to customer information, including account numbers, social security numbers, and other personal details. Preliminary investigations suggest that the breach occurred through a sophisticated malware attack that allowed hackers to infiltrate the institution's systems.
