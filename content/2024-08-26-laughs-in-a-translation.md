As a translator, I often get to experience the nuances of language in a way that my non-linguistic friends and family members can't quite fathom. You see, words don't always translate directly across cultures or languages, but humor often attempts to, much to hilarious effect. I recall a client who enthusiastically told me that he was going to "die laughing" when he saw his ex-girlfriend at the grocery store. To which I replied, laughing along with him, that "you will" literally "die laughing" - in Chinese, the phrase is 注意，我马上要哭死了 (zhu yì wǒ jiù cháng guò kuī shì le), but in the pun-filled homophone, kuī shì sounds like هو ("to die"). While my comprehension guided him toward the humor, only the context and cultural knowledge could ensure that he wouldn't die laughing.
