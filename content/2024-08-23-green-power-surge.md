In recent years, the world has witnessed a significant shift towards renewable energy sources as concerns about climate change and environmental degradation continue to grow. The global transition towards a more sustainable future is gaining momentum, with many countries investing heavily in green energy technologies. Solar and wind power are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels, making them a more viable option for meeting the world's energy demands. According to recent studies, the cost of solar panels has dropped by over 70% in the last decade, making it more accessible for individuals and businesses to install solar panels on their rooftops.
