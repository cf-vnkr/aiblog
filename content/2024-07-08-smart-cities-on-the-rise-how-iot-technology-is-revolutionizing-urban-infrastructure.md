In recent years, the concept of smart cities has gained significant traction, with many metropolitan areas around the world embracing the idea of leveraging technology to improve the daily lives of citizens. At the heart of this movement is the Internet of Things (IoT), which enables real-time monitoring and management of urban infrastructure, making cities more efficient, sustainable, and responsive to the needs of their residents. By integrating sensors, data analytics, and smart devices, smart cities can significantly reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic flow, and enhance public safety, ultimately creating a better quality of life for their citizens.
