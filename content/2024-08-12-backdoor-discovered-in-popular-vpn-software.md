A recent security audit of several popular virtual private network (VPN) software has revealed the presence of a significant security vulnerability, dubbed a "backdoor". The vulnerability, discovered in software from top VPN providers, allows unauthorized access to user data and undermines the encryption process, essentially rendering VPN protection useless. The compromised security measure has left millions of users potentially exposed to cyber threats, compromising their online anonymity and security.
