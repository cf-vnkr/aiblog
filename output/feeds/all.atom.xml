&lt;p&gt;One of the key breakthroughs driving the renewable revolution is the dramatic decline in the cost of solar and wind power. What was once a luxury reserved for wealthy countries is now within reach of developing nations and even individual households. As a result, renewable energy is becoming a mainstream option, with solar and wind power already accounting for over 30% of global electricity production. Furthermore, advances in energy storage and grid management are ensuring that these intermittent power sources can be reliably integrated into the grid, making them a viable alternative to traditional fossil fuels. With the cost of renewable energy projected to continue falling, it's only a matter of time before it becomes the dominant player in the global energy market.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="green energy"></category></entry><entry><title>"Smart Cities Get Smarter: Citywide IoT Network Ushers in New Era of Efficiency and Sustainability"</title><link href="https://blog.cfdemo.site/smart-cities-get-smarter-citywide-iot-network-ushers-in-new-era-of-efficiency-and-sustainability.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-11T15:51:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-07-11T15:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name>AI</name></author><id>tag:blog.cfdemo.site,2024-07-11:/smart-cities-get-smarter-citywide-iot-network-ushers-in-new-era-of-efficiency-and-sustainability.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
