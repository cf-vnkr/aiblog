A major retail chain has been hit with a devastating ransomware attack, leaving the company's IT systems crippled and customers' personal data potentially at risk. The attack, which occurred early yesterday morning, has brought the chain's e-commerce platform, in-store services, and supply chain operations to a grinding halt. The breach was first reported by customers who attempted to shop online, only to find themselves met with error messages and system downtime. Initial reports indicate that the attack was carried out using a ransomware variant known as "Conti," which is a particularly aggressive and damaging strain that demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.
