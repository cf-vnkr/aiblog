The idea of sending humans to Mars has long been a topic of interest for space agencies and private companies alike. With significant advancements in technology and economic investments, the prospect of establishing a human settlement on the Red Planet is becoming increasingly feasible. NASA's Artemis program, for example, aims to return humans to the lunar surface by 2024 and establish a sustainable presence on the Moon. The ultimate goal is to use the Moon as a stepping stone for a manned mission to Mars, with the possibility of establishing a permanent human settlement on the Martian surface.
