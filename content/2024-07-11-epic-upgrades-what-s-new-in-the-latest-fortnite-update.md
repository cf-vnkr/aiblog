The latest Fortnite update has dropped, and it's packed with some epic upgrades that are sure to shake up the game. At the top of the list is the new "Rebirth" mechanism, which allows players to revive themselves in creative new ways. For instance, if you're knocked out in the zone, you can now "respawn" at a nearby Rebirth Vortex, giving you a second chance to take down your opponents. This feature is sure to change the way players approach the last circle, and we can't wait to see how it plays out.
