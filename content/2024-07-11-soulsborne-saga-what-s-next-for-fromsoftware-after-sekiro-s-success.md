Rumors and speculation have been circulating about potential new projects in the works at FromSoftware. Some fans are hoping for a new game in the Souls series, while others are clamoring for a spin-off or sequel to Sekiro. In a recent interview, FromSoftware's president, Hidetaka Miyazaki, hinted at the possibility of a new game that might deviate from the Soulsborne formula. While not confirming anything concrete, Miyazaki expressed interest in exploring new genres and gameplay mechanics. This has led many to speculate that FromSoftware might be working on a sci-fi or fantasy game that differs from their usual dark, medieval settings.
