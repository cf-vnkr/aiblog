The solar energy sector has witnessed unprecedented growth in recent years, with record-breaking installations and plummeting costs sending shockwaves throughout the industry. According to the latest figures released by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the world experienced a 21% increase in solar capacity additions in 2020, marked by a total of 139 gigawatts of new solar installations. This marked the first time solar energy reached over 700 gigawatts of global installed capacity, a significant milestone in the sector's rapid expansion.
