The world is witnessing a seismic shift in the way we generate and consume energy, as the renewable revolution gains momentum. In recent years, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels, making them a more viable option for households, businesses, and industries around the globe. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable energy capacity has grown by 20% in the past five years, with solar energy alone seeing a 10-fold increase in the same period. This surge in renewable energy adoption has been driven by declining technology costs, improved efficiency, and innovative financing models, making it more accessible and affordable for people to transition to cleaner, more sustainable forms of energy.
