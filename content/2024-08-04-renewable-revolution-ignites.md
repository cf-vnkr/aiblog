The shift towards renewable energy has reached a tipping point. As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and diminishing fossil fuel reserves, the demand for sustainable power is skyrocketing. Wind and solar power, once niche technologies, are now mainstream. Solar panels are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with traditional energy sources, while wind farms are sprouting up across the globe. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that renewables will account for nearly 30% of global electricity generation by 2023, up from 23% in 2013.
