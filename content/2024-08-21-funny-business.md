As a professional assistant, I've seen my fair share of quirky characters and ridiculous requests. My boss, in particular, has a knack for making me laugh with his hilarious requests and antics. The other day, he asked me to arrange a " نرمee-cup-latte-pplxito quick détente" meeting with our marketing team, which apparently is a fancy way of saying a coffee break. I deadpanned him, asking if he'd like me to include a miniature breaking into the order for added emphasis. He burst out laughing, breaking the tension and reminding me to keep a stiff upper lip (and a poker face).
