The gaming industry has continued to experience unprecedented growth in recent years, with the COVID-19 pandemic serving as a significant catalyst for its expansion. As people around the world have turned to digital entertainment to pass the time and cope with social distancing measures, the demand for games has skyrocketed. According to a recent report, the global gaming market is expected to reach $190 billion in revenue by the end of the year, a significant increase from pre-pandemic estimates. This growth has been driven by the rise of cloud gaming, online multiplayer titles, and mobile gaming, which have become increasingly popular among players of all ages.
