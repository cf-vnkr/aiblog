In a bid to combat the rising threat of cyber attacks, some of the world's largest tech companies have joined forces to form a coalition aimed at protecting users' data from increasingly sophisticated online threats. The coalition, which includes industry giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, among others, was established in response to the growing concern that cyber attacks are becoming more frequent and complex, putting millions of users at risk. By pooling their resources and expertise, the companies hope to create a bastion of security against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.
