The threat of ransomware has been a concern for businesses and individuals for years, but a new breed of ransomware is emerging, more sophisticated and devastating than ever before. Dubbed "Ransomware 2.0," this updated threat landscape involves not only encrypting files and demanding payment for release, but also exfiltrating sensitive data and holding it hostage for good measure. This dual pronged approach creates a sense of existential dread for victims, making it even more challenging to recover from an attack. Unlike traditional ransomware, which typically consists of a single, phoned-in demand, Ransomware 2.0 combines the trauma of data encryption with the terror of data exposure, rendering entire organizations helpless.
