This year's E3 was abuzz with excitement as Sony finally took the wraps off the highly anticipated PlayStation 5, its next-generation console that promises to revolutionize the gaming experience. While many gamers were hoping for flashy new graphics or a powerful new controller, the true star of the show turned out to be a lesser-known feature that stole the spotlight: the Zen Zone.
