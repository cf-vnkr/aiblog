In a thrilling tweet posted on the official Epic Games Twitter account, fans of Fortnite received a cryptic tease for the upcoming new season. The post features a series of images showcasing a retro-inspired aesthetic, complete with pixelated fonts and a nostalgic color palette. While the images don't reveal too much, they hint at a significant change of pace for the popular battle royale game. The picture's collision with the minimalist design style is being interpreted as a nod to classic video games from the 80s and 90s.
