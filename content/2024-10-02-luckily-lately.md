It's been a while since I've been able to catch a break, and I have to say, it feels amazing to finally feel like things are falling into place. Whether it's snagging a great parking spot, receiving a surprise call from an old friend, or stumbling upon a hidden gem in the neighborhood, it seems like the universe has been smiling on me lately. And who doesn't love a little bit of good fortune? It's those small, serendipitous moments that make all the stress and hard work worth it.
