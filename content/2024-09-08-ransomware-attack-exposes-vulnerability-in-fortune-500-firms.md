In a recent wave of ransomware attacks, several Fortune 500 companies have been targeted by hackers, highlighting the need for improved cybersecurity measures in the business sector. The attacks, which have affected major corporations across various industries, have brought to light the ongoing vulnerability of even the largest and most secure organizations. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key. In some cases, the hackers have demanded millions of dollars in exchange for restoring access to the compromised data.
