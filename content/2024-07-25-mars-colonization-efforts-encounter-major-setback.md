The long-held dream of establishing a human settlement on Mars has hit a significant roadblock, dealing a major blow to NASA's ambitious plans for a manned mission to the Red Planet. A critical malfunction in the propulsion system of the spacecraft designed to transport the first batch of colonists has been identified, leaving engineers scrambling to find a solution before the launch window closes. The setback has sparked concerns among space experts that the mission may be delayed by years, if not scrapped altogether.
