The global shift towards renewable energy has never been more evident, with solar energy emerging as a leading player in the clean energy sector. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), solar energy has seen a remarkable growth spurt worldwide, setting a new record in the last year. Solar installations surpassed 127 gigawatts (GW) in 2022, a staggering 23% jump from the previous year. This surge is attributable to plummeting solar panel prices, improved technology, and an increasing demand for renewable energy sources.
