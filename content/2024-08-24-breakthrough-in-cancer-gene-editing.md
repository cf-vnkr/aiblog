Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of cancer gene editing, paving the way for a new era in cancer treatment. A team of researchers at a prominent university has successfully developed a gene editing tool that can selectively remove or repair cancer-causing mutations in human cells, a major breakthrough in the fight against cancer. This innovative technology, known as "cancer-specific CRISPR," has shown remarkable efficacy in lab tests, with the potential to revolutionize the treatment of various types of cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors.
