In a shocking revelation, a major data breach has occurred in the digital infrastructure of Smart City, a pioneering urban development project that aims to provide a seamless and efficient living experience for its residents. The breach, which is believed to have been ongoing for months, has compromised the personal data of over 1 million residents, including sensitive information such as financial records, medical histories, and contact details. An investigation into the breach has revealed that hackers gained access to the city's central data hub, using a combination of social engineering and non-password authentication techniques to bypass security measures.
