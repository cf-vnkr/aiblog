A groundbreaking discovery in the field of gene editing has sparked new optimism for the treatment of rare genetic disorders. Researchers have successfully utilized the CRISPR-Cas9 system to correct a genetic mutation responsible for a rare inherited disorder known as Batten disease. This advance has paved the way for the potential treatment of other rare diseases, which afflict a significant number of individuals worldwide. Batten disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately 2,500 children in the United States, causing severe physical and cognitive decline.
