A ransomware attack has brought a major financial institution to its knees, leaving thousands of customers without access to their accounts and sparking widespread panic. The attack, which was first detected on Tuesday morning, spread rapidly throughout the institution's computer system, encrypting sensitive data and demanding a hefty ransom in exchange for the decryption key. According to sources, the attackers claimed to have stolen sensitive customer information, including bank account numbers and social security numbers, and threatened to release it online unless they received a payment of $10 million in bitcoin.
