The world of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a paradigm shift in recent years, with major breakthroughs that are revolutionizing various industries and transforming the way businesses operate. One of the most significant advancements has been in the field of natural language processing (NLP), which has enabled AI systems to understand and process human language in a more sophisticated and accurate manner. This has led to the development of chatbots and virtual assistants that can engage with customers, respond to queries, and even provide personalized recommendations. Companies such as Amazon and Google have already integrated AI-driven chatbots into their customer service platforms, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and reduced support costs.
