In a groundbreaking achievement, scientists have made a significant breakthrough in gene therapy, a revolutionary treatment that involves introducing healthy copies of a gene into cells to replace faulty or missing ones. A team of researchers has successfully developed a gene therapy that can effectively treat severe inherited diseases by permanently repairing mutated genes. This innovative approach has the potential to cure a wide range of genetic disorders, including sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and muscular dystrophy.
