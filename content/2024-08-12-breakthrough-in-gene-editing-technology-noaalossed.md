Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have made a groundbreaking discovery in gene editing technology, eliminating the use of the enzyme Cas9. The enzyme, commonly used in the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique, has been replaced by a new protein called denoteutrix, which has shown to be more efficient and precise in editing genes. This breakthrough has significant implications for the treatment of genetic diseases, as it addresses the limitations of traditional gene editing methods that often have off-target effects.
