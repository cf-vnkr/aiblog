The solar industry has witnessed rapid growth over the past decade, driven by decreasing costs and increasing demand for renewable energy. However, a recent surge in material costs has slowed the expansion of solar capacity growth. According to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the growth rate of solar energy capacity additions has slowed to 7% in 2022, down from 20% in 2021. This news has sparked concerns among industry experts, as the sector struggles to maintain momentum despite its critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
