Laughter is a universal language that transcends cultures, ages, and languages. It has the power to bring people together, break down barriers, and even alleviate stress and anxiety. A good laugh can be beneficial for both our physical and mental well-being, and it's essential to incorporate laughter into our daily lives. When we laugh, our body releases endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters that can leave us feeling relaxed, happy, and energized.
